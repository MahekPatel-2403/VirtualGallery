# My First Art Gallery Website!

Hi! This is my project for my computer class. I made a simple webpage to show 5 of my favorite paintings.

---

###  Cool HTML things I used:

* Titles and paragraphs
* Bold and italic text
* Putting in pictures of the paintings
* Making links to jump to different parts of the page
* Creating a table to compare the art
* Making bullet point lists and numbered lists

---

###  How to See My Website:

1.  Click the green `<> Code` button on this page and then click `Download ZIP`.
2.  Unzip the folder on your computer.
3.  Find the file named `art_gallery.html` and double-click it. It will open in your web browser!

###  Files in this Folder:

* `art_gallery.html` - The main webpage.
* All the `.png` files - These are the pictures of the paintings.
* The PDF file - This is my project report for my teacher.

Thanks for checking out my project!
